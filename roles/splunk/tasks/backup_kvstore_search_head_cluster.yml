# Key Points from the Documentation:

#     Single Backup at a Time in a Search Head Cluster:
#         In a Search Head Cluster, only one backup operation can take place at a time.
#         If you try to initiate a backup on more than one search head at the same time, only one will succeed.

#     Backup with Point-in-Time Consistency:
#         The recommended command to back up the KV store with point-in-time consistency is:

#         bash

#     ./splunk backup kvstore -pointInTime true

#     This command creates an archive file in the $SPLUNK_DB/kvstorebackup directory. Point-in-time consistency ensures that changes made during the backup are captured.

# Run Backup from the Search Head:

#     For a Search Head Cluster, run the backup kvstore command from the captain node (the node with the most recent data).
#     The backup is replicated across all the nodes in the cluster, so you only need to initiate the backup from one node.
